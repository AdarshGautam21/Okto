Self-Custody Wallets:
Avail is EVM-compatible, so you can use any EVM-compatible wallet, such as MetaMask, to interact with the Avail testnet. Here's how:

Install MetaMask: Download and install MetaMask from the official website.
Add Avail Testnet: Go to the "Networks" dropdown menu in MetaMask and select "Custom RPC."
Enter Network Details: Fill in the following details:
Network Name: Avail Testnet
New RPC URL: wss://ws.testnet.avail.network
Chain ID: 2224 (This is the current chain ID for Avail Testnet and might change. Please refer to official documentation for the latest updates.)
Currency Symbol: TXL
Block Explorer URL: (Currently not available, as Avail is in the testnet phase)
Save Network: Click "Save" to add the Avail Testnet network to MetaMask.
Getting Testnet Tokens (TXL):
You can request TXL tokens from the Avail Faucet to interact with the testnet. The faucet is typically accessible through the Avail Discord community or official channels.
