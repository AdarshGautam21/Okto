# Understanding Avail's Block Time

The average block time on the Avail blockchain is not a fixed value. It is designed to be dynamic and adjusts based on network conditions.

## How Avail's Block Time Works

Avail uses a consensus mechanism called GRANDPA (GHOST-based Recursive Ancestor Deriving Prefix Agreement) along with BABE (Blind Assignment for Blockchain Extension).

### GRANDPA
- Responsible for finalizing blocks, ensuring their immutability.

### BABE
- Handles the creation of new blocks in a probabilistic way based on stake weight.

This combination allows for fast block production while maintaining the security of finality. The target block time is often around 6 seconds, but it can vary depending on factors like:

- **Network Congestion:** Higher transaction volume can lead to slightly longer block times.
- **Validator Participation:** The number of active validators and their stake can influence the block production rate.

## Estimating Average Block Time

While there's no single definitive value, you can estimate the average block time by observing the blockchain in real-time:

### Using RPC Call

1. **Query Latest Finalized Block:**
   ```javascript
   const latestFinalizedBlock = await api.rpc.chain.getFinalizedHead();
   ```

2. **Observe:**
   Note the block number and timestamp. Wait for a few blocks to be finalized.

3. **Calculate:**
   - Subtract the initial block number from the later block number to find the number of blocks produced.
   - Subtract the initial timestamp from the later timestamp to find the time elapsed.
   - Divide the time elapsed by the number of blocks to get an average block time.

### Example

```
Initial Block: 123456 at 10:00:00 AM
Later Block:   123500 at 10:06:30 AM
```

- Blocks Produced: 44
- Time Elapsed: 390 seconds
- Average Block Time: 390 / 44 â‰ˆ 8.86 seconds

## Important Notes

- This is just a snapshot in time. The average block time can fluctuate.
- For a more accurate average, you can calculate it over a larger number of blocks or use specialized tools that track block times.
- Avail's documentation may provide additional insights or updated target block time information.

By understanding and estimating the block time, developers and users of Avail can better anticipate network performance and make more informed decisions regarding their interactions with the blockchain.
