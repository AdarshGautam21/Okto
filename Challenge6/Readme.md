<h2>Errors Encountered in Avail Blockchain Transactions:</h2>

**1. Insufficient Balance:**

* **Error:** "Insufficient funds for gas * price + value"
* **Reason:** The account attempting the transaction does not have enough tokens to cover the gas fee (calculated as gas limit * gas price) and the value being transferred.

**2. Lower Gas Price:**

* **Error:** "Transaction underpriced" or "below base fee"
* **Reason:** The gas price set in the transaction is too low compared to the network's minimum or current average. This can result in the transaction being delayed or not included in a block at all.

**3. Lower Gas Limit:**

* **Error:** "Out of gas"
* **Reason:** The gas limit set is insufficient to complete the transaction's execution. This means the computation required by the transaction exceeds the allocated gas.

**4. Higher Nonce/Sequence Number:**

* **Error:** "Nonce too high" or "invalid nonce"
* **Reason:** The nonce is a counter for transactions from an account. Each transaction must have a sequential nonce. A higher nonce indicates a transaction out of order and will be rejected.

**5. Lower Nonce/Sequence Number:**

* **Error:** "Nonce too low"
* **Reason:** Similar to the previous case, a lower nonce indicates a transaction has already been processed and will be rejected as a replay attempt.

**6. Account Not Initialized:**

* **Error:** "Account not found" or "account does not exist"
* **Reason:** The account specified in the transaction has not yet been created on the blockchain or has been deleted.

**7. Different Signer:**

* **Error:** "Invalid signature"
* **Reason:** The transaction was signed by an unexpected account, different from the one intended to authorize the transaction.

**8. Multiple Signers:**

* **More Than Required Signers:** This is generally not an error. If a transaction requires multiple signatures, exceeding that number won't invalidate the transaction.
* **Less Than Required Signers:**
    * **Error:** "Insufficient signatures"
    * **Reason:** The transaction does not meet the minimum number of required signatures to be considered valid.

**Additional Relevant Errors:**

* **Invalid Recipient Address:** The recipient address is malformed or does not exist.
* **Contract Reverted:** The execution of a smart contract transaction failed due to an internal error or condition.
* **Block Gas Limit Exceeded:** The total gas used by all transactions in a block exceeds the block's gas limit.

**Mitigation:**

* Ensure sufficient balance for gas and value.
* Use appropriate gas price estimates from tools like AvailScan.
* Accurately estimate the required gas limit for your transaction.
* Maintain correct nonce values for your transactions.
* Verify account initialization and existence.
* Double-check the signer's address.
* Ensure the correct number of signers for multi-signature transactions.
