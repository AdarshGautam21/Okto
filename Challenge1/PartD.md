<h2>DEXs, Marketplaces and Block Explorers on Avail:</h2> 

Given that Avail is still in the testnet phase, the ecosystem of block explorers, DEXs, and NFT marketplaces is still emerging.

**Block Explorers:**
AvailScan: AvailScan is the official block explorer for Avail. It's currently in development but will eventually allow you to explore blocks, transactions, and account details on the Avail network.


**DEXs and NFT Marketplaces:**

There aren't any widely used DEXs or NFT marketplaces specifically built for Avail yet. However, as Avail is EVM-compatible, it's possible that existing Ethereum DEXs and NFT marketplaces could be integrated with Avail in the future.
