# Avail Encoding and Address Information

## Native Encoding

Avail uses the same encoding as Ethereum for wallet addresses and private keys:

### Wallet Addresses
- **Format:** Hexadecimal string prefixed with "0x"
- **Example:** `0x0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef01234567`

### Private Keys
- **Format:** Hexadecimal string
- **Example:** `abcdef0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef0123456789`

## Length in Bytes

### Wallet Addresses
- **Length:** 20 bytes

### Private Keys
- **Length:** 32 bytes

## Rollup Details

Avail is not a rollup in the traditional sense of Optimistic or Zero-Knowledge Rollups. Instead, Avail focuses on data availability, providing a foundation for other scaling solutions like rollups to be built on top of it.

### Key Points
- **Data Availability:** Avail ensures that data is available and accessible for other blockchain scaling solutions.
- **Foundation for Rollups:** While not a rollup itself, Avail can support the development and operation of rollups by providing reliable data availability.

## Conclusion

Understanding the encoding and structure of Avail wallet addresses and private keys is essential for developers and users interacting with the Avail blockchain. Additionally, recognizing Avail's role in the broader ecosystem helps clarify its purpose and potential applications in blockchain scaling.
