# Avail: A Data Availability-Centric Layer 2

## Overview
Avail is a pioneering Layer 2 (L2) blockchain solution designed to address the scalability challenges faced by Ethereum. Unlike other L2s that focus on computation, Avail's specialization lies in data availability. This ensures that all transaction data is readily accessible for verification, a critical aspect of blockchain scalability and security.

Avail Blockchain is a pioneering force in the Web3 space, forging a new category with its Unification Layer. This innovative technology stack combines data availability, aggregation, and shared security to create a cohesive, user-friendly experience within the flexible and modular blockchain ecosystem.

Avail's cutting-edge approach harnesses validity proofs and KZG Polynomial commitments to guarantee immediate and reliable data availability, fostering scalability, security, and adaptability across the Web3 landscape. By prioritizing interoperability and cooperation between diverse blockchain networks, Avail aims to streamline the user experience while establishing a more integrated and efficient blockchain ecosystem.

## Key Advantages

### Scalability Through Data Availability
Avail's modular architecture, coupled with its focus on data availability, enables high transaction throughput at significantly lower costs than Ethereum's mainnet. This is achieved by offloading data storage and availability to Avail, freeing up Ethereum to focus on computation and consensus.

### Data Availability Sampling (DAS)
This innovative protocol guarantees data integrity while minimizing storage requirements. DAS involves randomly sampling data chunks, making it highly efficient for verifying large amounts of data without the need to download everything. This is crucial for complex applications like rollups, where data availability is essential for fraud proofs and state verification.

### Developer-Friendly DSL
Avail's Domain-Specific Language (DSL) is designed to streamline smart contract development. Its intuitive syntax and powerful features, inspired by Rust, make it easier for developers to create secure and efficient dApps. The DSL is designed to prevent common programming errors, enhancing the overall security of Avail smart contracts.

### Ethereum Compatibility
Avail is built to be fully compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). This means that existing Ethereum smart contracts can be deployed on Avail with minimal modifications. Developers can leverage familiar tools and libraries, reducing the learning curve and accelerating development.

### Pioneering a New Category
Avail is not merely a product; it's spearheading a new category in the blockchain space with its Unification Layer.

#### Unification Layer
