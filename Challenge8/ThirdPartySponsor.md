# Multiple Sponsors for Avail Transactions

**Avail**, in its current state, does not natively support multiple sponsors for a single transaction. However, there are workarounds and potential future enhancements to consider.

## Approaches for Multiple Sponsors

### 1. Off-Chain Aggregation

**How it Works:**
- Multiple sponsors send funds (the native token or a compatible asset) to a designated "sponsor pool" account.
- The transaction creator uses the balance of this pool account to cover the fees for their transaction.

**Pros:**
- Simpler to implement, as it doesn't require blockchain modifications.

**Cons:**
- Requires trust and coordination among sponsors.
- Adds complexity to managing the pool account and distributing rewards/reimbursements if needed.

### 2. Chain Extension (Custom Pallet)

**How it Works:**
- Develop a new pallet (module) for the Avail runtime that natively handles multiple sponsorships.
- This pallet would track contributions from each sponsor, allocate fees accordingly, and potentially even allow for weighted contributions or different fee structures.

**Pros:**
- More elegant and integrated solution within the blockchain's logic.
- Could enable more advanced features like:
  - Weighted sponsorships (sponsors contributing different amounts).
  - Custom fee calculations based on the number of sponsors or other factors.

**Cons:**
- Requires significant development effort and expertise in Substrate/Rust.
- Introduces additional complexity to the blockchain's runtime, which could impact performance.

## Considerations and Limitations

### Gas Limit
- Avail's block weight limit restricts the total gas used per block. High sponsorship activity could impact this.

### Fees
- Transaction fees are dynamic and depend on network congestion, so the total cost for sponsors can vary.

### Stablecoin Usage
- If using stablecoins for repayment, ensure the chosen stablecoin is available on Avail and has sufficient liquidity.

### Security
- Thoroughly test and audit any code used for managing sponsorships and financial transactions.

### Gas Estimation
- Add a buffer to your gas limit estimates to account for potential variations.

### Coordination
- Establish clear communication and trust mechanisms if using off-chain aggregation of sponsors.
